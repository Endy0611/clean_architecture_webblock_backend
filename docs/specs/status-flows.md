# WebBlock — Status values (from the Data Dictionary)

Use these exact enum values (UPPER_CASE in DB and Java, mapped to friendly labels in the UI).
The arrows are the normal path read from the specs and workflow; anything not shown needs team approval.

## Publish flow (Admin › Monitoring › Pipeline & Generation)
Four phases: **Request → Generation → Release → Live**
- Request = `project_generation_requests` CAPTURED
- Generation = `ai_codegen_harness_runs` + `validation_runs`, then push to Git (GENERATING / PUBLISHING)
- Release = `provisioning_releases` BUILDING … PROMOTING (+ `release_steps`)
- Live = release `LIVE`, `project_hosting.live_release_id` set
